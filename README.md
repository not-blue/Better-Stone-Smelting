# Better Stone Smelting

You can smelt cobblestone blocks to stone blocks and stone to smooth stone blocks, so why not stairs and slabs? This pack adds three shortcut recipes (and corresponding recipe unlocks):
- Smelt cobblestone stairs into stone stairs
- Smelt cobblestone slabs into stone slabs
- Smelt stone slabs into smooth stone slabs

**New!** The pack also includes recipes for sandstone:
- Smelt sandstone stairs into smooth sandstone stairs
- Smelt sandstone slabs into smooth sandstone slabs
- Smelt red sandstone stairs into smooth red sandstone stairs
- Smelt red sandstone slabs into smooth red sandstone slabs
